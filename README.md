# Data Science Methods
## Mini Projects in Machine Learning and Computational Techniques 

This repository contains mini Projects from my **Data Science coursework**, showcasing applications of core **machine learning and statistical methods** in Python. 
Each folder represents a self-contained project with Jupyter/Colab notebooks, code, and results. 

- Machine Learning (regression, clustering, decision trees, optimization)
- Python (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels)
- Statistical analysis and interpretation
