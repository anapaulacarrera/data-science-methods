# Machine Learning Using Trees 
## Tree-Based Classification Models for Predicting Spotify User Churn 
This project explores multiple tree-based machine learning algorithms to predict whether a Spotify user will churn. Using the spotify Churn dataset from Kaggle (~8,000 users, 12 features), several model architectures were trained, tuned, and compared to understand which patterns best identify at-risk users.

We implement and evaluate: 
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

Beyond predicted accuracy, this project focuses on model interpretability, feature importance, visualization, and handling class imbalance.

### Key Skills
- Building and tuning tree-based models
- Data preprocessing and categorical encoding
- Feature importance and correlation analysis
- Mdel evaluation using precision/recall, F1-Score, ROC/AUC
- Confusion matrix analysis for imabalances classification
