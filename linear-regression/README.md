# Linear Regression (SGD & OlS)
## Implementing Regression Models in Python 

This project explores linear regression techniques using two approaches: 
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGDRegressor) from scikit-learn
- Ordinary Least Squares from statsmodels

The data set used is the Wine Quality dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality), containing ~4,900 observations of red and white wine samples with physicochemical properties (pH, alcohol, acidity, etc.) as predictors and quality score (0–10) as the target variable.

### Key Skills 
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, normalization)  
- Feature engineering and correlation analysis  
- Regression modeling (SGD hyperparameter tuning, OLS diagnostics)  
- Model evaluation using R², RMSE, residual plots, and statistical interpretation  
- Visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
